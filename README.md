## Identifying Spatial Patterns in Phytoplankton Phenology in the Northern California Current

OCEAN 215 Final Project

In this project I sought to answer the question: how does phytoplankton phenology vary spatially in the Northern California Current? Using k-means clustering, I separated chlorophyll climatological time series into six clusters with similar patterns. These areas fell into three main 'phenoregions': on-shelf, off-shelf, and Juan de Fuca Strait, with the off-shelf areas having both spring and autumn blooms, the on-shelf areas having a sustained summer peak, and the Juan de Fuca Strait being variable year-round with a short spring bloom. These results illustrated the ways that bloom patterns and seasonality changes spatially off the coast of Washington, impacting the entire ecosystem by defining where primary production, the base of the food chain, happens.
